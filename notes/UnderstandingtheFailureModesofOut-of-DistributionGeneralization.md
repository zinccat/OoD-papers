## Understanding the Failure Modes of Out-of-Distribution Generalization

试图解答这样的问题: 为何ERM在OoD任务上表现不好?

Through a theoretical study of gradient-descent trained linear classiﬁers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature, and another, statistical in nature.
